# Caravel_soc_practice

Hey, if you are trying to test the caravel_user_project 32bit counter example (for the tag before mpw-3) for generating gds files for mpw run and getting some errors while executing the OpenLane flow, this is for you!
Please have a look at the caravel_user_project.txt file

NOTE: IF YOU CLONE THE LATEST VERSION OF CARAVEL_USER_PROJECT (-mpw 3) YOU SHOULDNT BE GETTING ANY ERRORS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF COMPLETION OF GENERATING GDS, AS ALL THESE ERRORS STATED IN THE TEXT FILE HAVE BEEN SOLVED!
